## Short description
A simple image viewer intended to be as simple and fast as possible.
Intention is to create something to be used instead of default Photos application on Windows 10 as the [problem with arrow keys](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-photos-app-why-cant-i-use-my-arrow-keys/790e786d-b701-48ef-93c5-23d204b4fba4) could not be solved.

## Feature list
* Portable, no installation required
* View, zoom and rotate images
* Background thread for image loading

## How to build and use
A standard Maven project, build from cmd or use Eclipse. Currently buildable as jar but [launch4j](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/docs.html) config will be added later in order to get .exe for Windows users.
